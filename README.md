# DUEL COMMANDER BANLIST
A new service to help developpers to keep an up-to-date data.

## THE SOLUTION TO KEEP THE PROJECT UPDATED
* Each banlist is stored as `txt` file of already established human-readable format (in `./banlists` folder)
* Static files generated by running two scripts (`create_banlist_json.py` and `create_banlist_html.py`) which uses banlists files to create the main part of the document, and adds html header/footer from static files (`static/banlist_html_header.txt` and `static/banlist_html_footer.txt`)

### BANLIST FILE FORMAT
File name must be `%Y%m%d.txt` format. The first lines order (Date...Changes) is important as their values are used for ToC generation. Each section must be created using the following template so that the script can integrate comments to the (un)banned card.

### HOW TO ADD NEW BANLIST
1. Put banlist file `%Y%m%d.txt` file into `./banlists`
1. Re-run python `create_banlist_json.py` and `create_banlist_html.py`
*Similar works to edit/delete the deck.*
