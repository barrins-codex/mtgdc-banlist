    <h1>Duel Commander banlists</h1>
    <p>
        This site is a collection of banlists issued by the
        Duel Commander Rules Committee. It is not the official
        source but a HTML document generated by @Spigushe for
        the Barrin's Codex website and to have a JSON  tool to
        be kept up to date as for developpers interested in
        building tools for the format
