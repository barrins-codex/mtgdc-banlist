        This site is a collection of banlists issued by the
        Duel Commander Rules Committee. It is not the official
        source but a HTML document generated by @Spigushe for
        the Barrin's Codex website and to have a JSON  tool to
        be kept up to date as for developpers interested in
        building tools for the format

JANUARY 2016 RULES - BANNED/RESTRICTED UPDATE
Duel Commander gets played more and more in the world, and regional coordinators have joined the
committee to help us take the worldwide community into account. We want to thank the coordinators
for their help and we also want to thank all of you who participate in the expansion of Duel
Commander.
##
Individual:Cataclysm is unbanned.
Rules:The Duel Commander rules indicate that adding mana of any color to your mana pool that is not
part of your Commander’s color identity gives colorless mana instead. Colorless mana obtained this
way can be used to cast spells and use abilities that require "true colorless" mana (the new “◇”
symbol replacing the ① for costs). Cards which generate mana of any color (for example: City of
Brass, Coalition Relic, Birds of paradise, ...) allow their controllers to use cards that require
"true colorless" mana if your commander doesn't have a 5-color identity, for example.
Other:No changes.
##
Cataclysm:Cataclysm is a card with a very high power level and that requires a specific setup to
really shine. That was relatively easy to set up when Mystical Tutor was legal, since it allowed
players to either find a necessary piece of disruption or a perfectly-timed Cataclysm. Now that
Mystical Tutor is banned, the card should be less regularly backbreaking than it used to be.
Besides, the decks that will benefit the most from that unban aren't the best positionned in the
format (Abzan Disrupt / Geist of Saint Traft / Grand Arbiter Augustin IV).

SEPTEMBER 2015 RULES - BANNED/RESTRICTED UPDATE
During the last three months, the format kept growing. We have been in contact with more and more
communities, and we hope this will go on in the future.
##
Individual:Sensei's divining top is now banned.
Rules: The Vancouver mulligan is now the legal mulligan in Dual Commander. Over the last years, the
partial mulligan has changed from being a tool that was used to have less games lost on the starting
hand to a powerful engine used in some strategies to take an early lead. During the last 3 months,
we decided to test the Vancouver mulligan. It appears it still allows players to play real Magic:
The Gathering games while not threatening the balance between decks and strategies. It seemed to be
the optimal solution for the Dual Commander format.
Other:No changes.
##
Sensei's divining top:The card was creating a lot of fuss because of its power and its impact on the
games' durations. During those 6 month being unbanned, Top didn't seem to have any positive impact
on the format, powering up decks that were already dominant decks. That's why Sensei's divining top
is now banned.

JULY 2015 RULES - BANNED/RESTRICTED UPDATE
Over the last three months, Duel Commander events have been more numerous and more populated. The
player activity on all media was also very intensive. Such dynamics are very positive for the format
and we hope that it will keep on going.
##
Individual:Mystical Tutor is now banned.
Rules:A commander will now be able to be put back to the Command Zone instead of going to its
owner’s hand. This recent rules change has been added to multiplayer Commander recently. We chose to
also have it apply to Duel Commander.
Other:No changes.
##
Mystical Tutor:Mystical Tutor is a card that really favoured combo and control decks to the
detriment of aggressive decks, which is the opposite of the re-balancing decisions that our comitee
turns to. Some of its interactions were formidable (miracle keyword cards) and it was really making
players take too much advantage over the 99 unique cards rule, allowing players to include powerful
but situational cards (like Armageddon / Upheaval) with lesser risks. Seeing it banned also opens
other unbans in the long run.

MARCH 2015 RULES - BANNED/RESTRICTED UPDATE
The format keeps growing, thanks to players’ involvement and thanks to new sets being released,
especially the ones that are dedicated to Commander. Choices among new legendary creatures with a
strong identity allow players to play a wide range of efficient strategies. We would like to promote
such a diversity as much as possible. Having considered the current context, we do think players
need a maximum number of possibilities to properly explore the current metagame. Nevertheless, we
still have to restrict the overly fast pace of some unbalanced strategies.
##
Individual:Entomb is now banned.
Individual:Food Chain is now banned.
Individual:Fastbond is now banned.
Individual:Winter Orb is now unbanned.
Individual:Crucible Of Worlds is now unbanned.
Individual:Sensei's Divining Top is now unbanned.
Individual:Braids, Cabal Minion is now unbanned.
Rules:No changes.
Other:No changes.
##
Entomb:This cards allows explosive combos too early in the game. It’s the only card that both allows
searching through a library and moving a card in a beneficial zone for one single mana. The
possibility given by Entomb overwehlms widely the structure we would like to give to Duel Commander.
Food Chain:Food Chain is widely used in Duel Commander as the exile restriction is easily bypassed…
Thanks to the Commander rule and the specificities of some legendary creatures. Some of them allow
immediate recursion and a “collateral” profit. We do consider that the speed of such actions is
really too fast and also that interaction with those actions becomes too hard.
Fastbond:Fastbond is a dreadful mana accelerating card when played on the first turns but such a use
remains seldom. Later in the game, its effect often becomes more limited by the inability to gather
several lands in hand. Yet, sometimes, a synergy can break this (a “bounce-land”, cards like
Upheaval, Sunder,…). Because of the releasing of new BUG possible commanders, such synergies found
new homes, in which they become “unhealthy” for the format. Moreover, we think that Crucible Of
Worlds and Fastbond shouldn’t be on the same side of the banned/authorized lists. Those two cards
together are too explosive for the format.
Winter Orb:Having to face a growing number of decklists that revolve around final combos (hybrid
decks such as aggro/combo or control/combo), it appeared to us that we should offer an alternate
“stax/prison” path for all archetypes. Such a path exists under many forms when based on the
specifications of the commander -whether we talk about its color(s) or power(s)-, but having access
to an artifact offers more possibilities.
Crucible Of Worlds:Previous statements regarding Winter Orb also apply here. The possibilities that
are offered by Crucible Of Worlds as a constraints means or as a developing basis favours
interactive strategies. Having Crucible Of Worlds back also follows the editor’s choices, who
considers graveyards as a whole resourceful zone, as opposed to the exile zone, that is a real zone
of no return.
Sensei's Divining Top:Today, duel commander is supported by a lot of new associations and actively
played by a lot of people. Therefore, it doesn’t seem appropriate for us to continue to monitor
playing time management and to take it as an element into consideration. Having excluded these
considerations, we believe that this card isn’t unfair.
Braids, Cabal Minion:This commander has been banned for a long time. Since then, all means available
to put it into play quickly while paying its upkeep conditions have been limited. Moreover, the
format gave birth to a lot of powerful decks. We think that Braids, Cabal Minion can fit in duel
commander without having a negative impact on the format.

The metagame is still shifting and hasn’t stabilized. At the moment the format looks healthy so no
changes appear necessary.
