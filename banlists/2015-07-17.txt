JULY 2015 RULES - BANNED/RESTRICTED UPDATE
Over the last three months, Duel Commander events have been more numerous and more populated. The player activity on all media was also very intensive. Such dynamics are very positive for the format and we hope that it will keep on going.
##
Individual:Mystical Tutor is now banned.
Rules:A commander will now be able to be put back to the Command Zone instead of going to its ownerâ€™s hand. This recent rules change has been added to multiplayer Commander recently. We chose to also have it apply to Duel Commander.
Other:No changes.
##
Mystical Tutor:Mystical Tutor is a card that really favoured combo and control decks to the detriment of aggressive decks, which is the opposite of the re-balancing decisions that our comitee turns to. Some of its interactions were formidable (miracle keyword cards) and it was really making players take too much advantage over the 99 unique cards rule, allowing players to include powerful but situational cards (like Armageddon / Upheaval) with lesser risks. Seeing it banned also opens other unbans in the long run.
