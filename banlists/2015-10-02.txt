SEPTEMBER 2015 RULES - BANNED/RESTRICTED UPDATE
During the last three months, the format kept growing. We have been in contact with more and more communities, and we hope this will go on in the future.
##
Individual:Sensei's divining top is now banned.
Rules: The Vancouver mulligan is now the legal mulligan in Dual Commander. Over the last years, the partial mulligan has changed from being a tool that was used to have less games lost on the starting hand to a powerful engine used in some strategies to take an early lead. During the last 3 months, we decided to test the Vancouver mulligan. It appears it still allows players to play real Magic: The Gathering games while not threatening the balance between decks and strategies. It seemed to be the optimal solution for the Dual Commander format.
Other:No changes.
##
Sensei's divining top:The card was creating a lot of fuss because of its power and its impact on the games' durations. During those 6 month being unbanned, Top didn't seem to have any positive impact on the format, powering up decks that were already dominant decks. That's why Sensei's divining top is now banned.
